                <p class="headingText"><mark class="headingMark">Identifying The Themes - What is Discussed in The Novel?</mark></p>
                  <p>Within <i>"How The Steel Was Tempered"</i> 3 main themes can be identified based on what is discussed within the novel and its plot. Firstly, the qualities which make a good communist that is bravery, commitment to principle, kindness, and selflessness. Secondly what causes one to become a communist, which the novel implies to be hardships and struggle, which galvanizes one toward the communist cause and motivates them to continue fighting on, and the process to becoming a communist is a long and protracted one (but is overall worth it). And lastly how revolution has advanced, improved, Ukrainian society.</p>

                <p class="headingText"><mark class="headingMark">What Makes A Communist? What Are Their Qualities And Where Do They Come From?</mark></p>
                  <p>The novel rather clearly communicates what the characteristics of a good communist are via a myriad of means. Firstly through the determining of the protagonist as already having the desired traits. For example, in chapter 1 it starts off with describing Pavel's experience in fighting against tyrannical authority. Only on page 2 the novel says:</p>
                  
                  <p class="quote"><i>"His childish heart rebelled against any injustice, however slight. He could not forgive the priest for the undeserved beating, and he grew sullen and bitter."</i><sup><a href="https://www.redstarpublishers.org/ostrovsky_steel.pdf">[1]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Here it is directly declared the protagonist's, Pavel, basic character which is in line with the socialist realist principles of promoting revolutionary ideals, that is opposition to injustice. The implicit choice of selecting a protagonist with these characteristics, already, and emphasizing them so early, thus emphasizing their importance, works to communicate the superb value possessing such characteristics has. Had his rebellious and justice orientated mindset been emphasized later or done more in passing it would have suggested that such things weren't so important or was only a minor point in the story. The mere fact that the novel starts out with a scene of Pavel in conflict, or rather in the midst of struggle, immediately communicates that such things are not only of immense importance to the story but are seen as important things in development in general.</p>
                  
                  <p>And so that is another way that Ostrovsky communicates in the novel the characteristics of what a communist is. By strategically crafting scenes where the protagonist is tested and forced to show their true colors. Which also works to communicate the processes which produce communists. That is also a key Marxist perspective in relation to the formation of communists in particular but all things in general. The Marxist worldview is that of things progressing in stages progressed by struggle. Hoxha's <i>"For the Continuous Improvement of the Composition of the Party"</i> is a good albeit slightly tangential read on this subject matter.<sup><a href="https://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/hoxha/works/1966/11/01.htm">[2]</a></sup> Particularly for understanding what the characteristics of a communist are and so how they are present in Pavel's development through the novel.</p>
                  
                  <p>Perhaps the most notable example of this throughout the entire novel would be Pavel's splitting with his close childhood friend he had made, Tonya. As Pavel's transformation into a communist developed to greatening heights toward the end of the first volume he could no longer stay friends with Tonya due to her individualism which was juxtaposed to the escalating collectivist mindset Pavel had been developing with his continued work in the young communist league. The split occurs on page 139 with Pavels concluding remarks in their arguing being:</p>
                  
                  <p class="quote"><i>"Tonya, cut yourself loose and come to us. Let’s work together to finish with the bosses. There are many splendid girls among us who are sharing the burden of this bitter struggle, enduring all the hardships and privation. They may not be so well educated as you are, but why, oh why, don’t you want to join us? You say Chuzhanin tried to seduce you, but he is a degenerate, not a fighter. You say the comrades were unfriendly toward you. Then why did you have to dress up as if you were going to a bourgeois ball? It’s your silly pride that’s to blame: why should I wear a dirty old army tunic just because everybody else does? You had the courage to love a workingman, but you cannot love an idea. I am sorry to have to part with you, and I should like to cherish your memory."</i><sup><a href="https://www.redstarpublishers.org/ostrovsky_steel.pdf">[3]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p> In the entirety of the first volume of the novel this by far is the ultimate expression of all the characteristics of what a communist is ideally purported to be. Here Pavel is brave enough to confront his now long time friend in regard to their clash in principles and from that, courageous enough to actual split with her upon recognizing the relationship can't be salvaged. He places his commitment to principles so high that it triumphs over his commitment to any individual friendship, compelling to cause the split with Tonya. And in a certain sense he is being selfless as well as he is putting the interests and needs of the young communist league above his own personal relationships. It too is an exposition of how communists, are expected to, develop, that is gradually overtime through various struggles. This conflict with his friend, in a way, helped make Pavel be a better, more ideal, communist. Galvanizing him to be more committed and resolute in his principles as a communist is expected to be. Thus communicating how incremental trials make communists <i>over time</i>.</p>
                
                <p class="headingText"><mark class="headingMark">How Revolution Changes Society For The Better</mark></p>
                  <p>The last theme of note within the novel would be how (socialist) revolution had driven Ukrainian society in a positive direction, and so from that, how it is necessary to continue revolution until it's completion. This theme is more so made apparent with the context of what Nikolai Ostrovsky said directly in regards to his motivations for writing in "HAIL LIFE". On page 30 he writes:</p>
                  
                  <p class="quote"><i>"In my new book I shall show these hangmen, show the past as it really was. I do this for our youth—that their hands may not hold back in battles to come, if battle is forced upon us."</i><sup><a href="https://archive.org/details/nikolai-ostrovsky-hail-life-articles-speeches-letters-flph-1950/page/30/mode/2up">[4]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>Though talking about his unfinished novel <i>"Born of the Storm"</i> what he says here in regards to his intention to write that novel relates back to the contents of this novel as within <i>How The Steel Was Tempered</i> it does do a substantial job at painting a picture of the enemies of revolution and life before revolution, how that was bad, and the positive impact of revolution. Take the following passages for example:</p>
                  
                  <p class="quote"><i>"Ma won’t need to go out to work any more. She’s slaved enough for all sorts of swine. Only see here, Pavka, you’ve got to be a man."</i><sup><a href="https://www.redstarpublishers.org/ostrovsky_steel.pdf">[5]</a></sup></p>
                  <p class="quote"><i>"They’ll come down hard on our folks, especially mine because we’re Poles. You, a Pole, they’ll say, opposing the Polish Legion. They’re sure to kick my old man out of the sawmill and flog him."</i><sup><a href="https://www.redstarpublishers.org/ostrovsky_steel.pdf">[6]</a></sup></p>
                  <p class="quote"><i>"“I don’t know myself, I only said that they were collecting signatures to a petition to the Chief Ataman from the Jewish population.” “What sort of petition?” both Chernyak and the Captain moved menacingly toward Zeitser. “A petition asking that pogroms be prohibited. You know, we had a terrible pogrom. The whole population’s afraid.” “That’s enough,” Chernyak interrupted him. “We’ll give you a petition you won’t forget, you dirty Jew.” Turning to the Captain, he snapped: “Put this one away properly. Have him taken to headquarters. I’ll have a talk with him there personally. We’ll see who’s behind this petition business.” Zeitser tried to protest but the Captain struck him sharply across the back with his riding whip. “Shut up, you bastard!”"</i><sup><a href="https://www.redstarpublishers.org/ostrovsky_steel.pdf">[7]</a></sup></p>
                  <p class="quote"><i>"Even if the strike’s broken under the threat of shooting, even if the workers are back at the job, the fire has been kindled and it can’t be put out any more. As for those three, they’re stout fellows true proletarians"</i><sup><a href="https://www.redstarpublishers.org/ostrovsky_steel.pdf">[8]</a></sup></p>
                  <p class="quote"><i>"“The past is gone never to return,” [...] “It is enough that our fathers and we ourselves slaved all our lives for the Potockis. We built palaces for them and in return His Highness the Count gave us just enough to keep us from dying of starvation. “How many years did the Potocki counts and the Sanguszko princes ride our backs? Are there not any number of Polish workers whom Potocki ground down just as he did the Russians and Ukrainians? And yet the count’s henchmen have now spread the rumour among these very same workers that the Soviet power will rule them all with an iron hand. “That is a foul lie, Comrades! Never have workingmen of different nationalities had such freedom as now. All proletarians are brothers. As for the gentry, we are going to curb them, you may depend on that.” [...] “Who is it that has made brothers spill each other’s blood? For centuries kings and nobles have sent Polish peasants to fight the Turks. They have always incited one nation against another. Think of all the bloodshed and misery they have caused! And who benefited by it all? But soon all that will stop. This is the end of those vermin. The Bolsheviks have flung out a slogan that strikes terror into the hearts of the bourgeoisie: ‘Proletarians of all lands, unite!’ There lies our salvation, there lies our hope for a better future, for the day when all workingmen will be brothers. Comrades, join the Communist Party!"</i><sup><a href="https://www.redstarpublishers.org/ostrovsky_steel.pdf">[9]</a></sup></p>
                  
                  <p>These passages each display how Ostrovsky communicates the state of society prior to revolution, the terror of counter-revolutionaries, and the new better world the Bolsheviks were attempting to construct. The final passage describes the Bolsheviks arrival in the village as a great victory, and even throughout that chapter it is filled with the jubilation of all sorts of characters in response to the re-arrival of the Bolsheviks in the village. Contrasted with the passage preceding it of when the nationalists were in charge and one of the experiences described with them, it paints a completely different, dark, picture. With substantial abuse and terror of the characters involved with the nationalists. Thus, this contrast displays the disparaging ways in which the rule of the Bolsheviks and non-Bolsheviks are communicated with a great slant toward the rule of the Bolsheviks. essentially expressing how their rule brought forth, necessary, revolution which overthrew the old order of things and emancipated the downtrodden people of the village. Thus revealing how the Ostrovsky works to include the benefits, and so too necessity, of revolution as a core theme of the novel.</p>
