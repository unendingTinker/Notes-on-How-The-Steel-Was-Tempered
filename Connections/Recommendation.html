                <p class="headingText"><mark class="headingMark">What I Thought of The Novel</mark></p>
                  <p>Overall I thought the novel was <i>very</i> good. I find myself getting motivated or otherwise agitated by media, literature especially, relatively easily and I was a big fan of the way Ostrovsky goes about getting the reader to become agitated and energized. The graphic selection of words help to paint a clear and vivid picture of the scenes in the novel and so connect with it rather easily.</p>
                  
                  <p>I also found it of use to get me to learn about the history of the revolution in that part of the former Russian Empire. I know this is technically a kind of fiction and all, but it was interesting to see a description of historical events through a narrative format. It also compelled me to learn more about the various factions of the civil war in Ukraine and social dynamics of western Ukraine at that time.</p>
                  
                  <p>I found it interesting, actually, how the various political forces more so forced themselves upon the town and the townsfolk find themselves more confused or in the dark about what is occurring. The arrival of the SRs initially for example is explained as happening rather suddenly and the village people being rather bewildered by their arrival. Perhaps its due to my raising in the information age and my constant thirst for knowledge but I find the concept of an army being able to go into a town and the majority of the population not even knowing what they stand for rather interesting. It seems like a lot rural people only properly caught wind of the various revolutionary movements after they had kicked off rather then there having been support for them beforehand. At least that's what I got from reading this novel thus far.</p>

                <p class="headingText"><mark class="headingMark"">How The Novel Impacted Me</mark></p>
                  <p>I would say that the novel impacted me most in an agitational sense. It does a really good job of stirring up the reader, I think, to support the cause for liberation and to loathe oppressors. It reinvigorated me to stand close to my principles and reinforce the "piecemeal mindset" I've been attempting to foster these past few months.</p>
                  
                <p class="headingText"><mark class="headingMark">Do I Recommend The Novel?</mark></p>
                  <p>Yes, I would say that I do recommend this novel to anyone interested in Soviet history, communist or socialist history, and the lives and culture of the Soviet people. It is an inspiring and beautiful book in my opinion worthy of its popularity, and very succinctly communicates the world outlook and principles of the socialist cause, that is the cause for the emancipation of all downtrodden and oppressed people. Links to different versions of the novel can be found in the bibliography below.</p>
